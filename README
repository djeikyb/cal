# Create a cli calendar

## The displayed calendar

Could use one or more of the designs below. Could also maybe commission some
  border art, downmix to ascii.

Would be cool to not append an 'e' to a date with an event; instead invert the
  two-col date field.

Alternatively, highlight event days with a colour, or have the 'e' be a
  different colour.

May want to number weeks for ease of selection in tui.

Probably want to display numbers for full week, even if day isn't in month.

  1.  when thinking about events, people care less about the division of months,
        more about the division of weeks.

  2.  given (1), a month should be defined as a small collection of weeks, more
        or less conforming to the standard month division.

  3.  thus, the last week of may 2012 should also show the first three days of
        june

For any of the above month views, a similar week view could be:

      2012,  Week 20,  May
 Mo   Tu   We   Th   Fr   Sa   Su
 14  (15) (16) (17)  18   19   20

15: vacation! driving to san dieg...
16: spending the day at sea world
17: driving back home

The descriptive text is the first x many characters from the event description. If the description is longer, use elipses.


## Specs: condensed

  1.  display an ascii text calendar
        - must show days
        - must show each day's events, if any

  2.  events can be:
        - added to a day
        - edited
        - deleted

  3.  event properties:
        - date
        - time start
        - time end
        - type (meeting, appointment, ...)
        - long description
        - guest list

  4.  guests can be:
        - created
        - edited
        - deleted
        - added to an event

  5.  guest properties:
        - id
        - name
        - email address


## Specs: blocked

    Create a text calendar with a mysql backend to save the data.


{
    The user interface will all be text.

    The interface will be able to display a diagram of the month
      - this is basically just drawing a calendar using ascii characters

    The calendar will show the day number in the corner of each box.

    Each day will also display all the events for that day.

    Feel free to be flexible when designing the interface
}


{
    The user will need to be able to add, edit, and delete events from the calendar.
}


{
    Create a class called CalendarRegistry which will have static methods for getting and saving the events.

    An Event bean must have a private int called id that is initialized to -1.
      - This will then be set to the actual database id after if the event has a corresponding record in the database.

    The event needs to keep track of:
      - what day the event is on
      - what time the event starts
      - what time the event ends
      - the type of event (meeting, appointment, etc)
      - a description of the event
      - and a list of guests invited to the event
}


{
    A guest will be represented in java with a Guest bean that has:
      - an id
      - name
      - and an email address
}


    A guest can be attending more than one event

    if a guest is attending more than one event the same guest database row should be used.


## Specs: from ticket

    Create a text calendar with a mysql backend to save the data. The user
    interface will all be text. Make the user interface as intuitive as you
    can. The interface will be able to display a diagram of the month, this is
    basically just drawing a calendar using dashes and pipes and any other
    ascii characters you want. The calendar will show the day number in the
    corner of each box. Try and make the text calendar look as nice as you
    can. Each day will also display all the events for that day. Feel free to
    be flexible when designing the interface but it does need to be intuitive
    and clear to the user. The user will need to be able to add, edit, and
    delete events from the calendar.

    Create a class called CalendarRegistry which will have static methods for
    getting and saving the events. An Event bean must have a private int
    called id that is initialized to -1. This will then be set to the actual
    database id after if the event has a corresponding record in the database.
    The event needs to keep track of what day the event is on, what time the
    event starts, what time the event ends, the type of event (meeting,
    appointment, etc), a description of the event, and a list of guests
    invited to the event. A guest will be represented in java with a Guest
    bean that has an id, name, and an email address. A guest can be attending
    more than one event, if a guest is attending more than one event there
    same guest database row should be used.

    Since these specs arenâ€™t all encompassing, please let me know if you have
    any questions on how this should work.
